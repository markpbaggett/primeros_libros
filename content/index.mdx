## About

The Primeros Libros de las Am√©ricas: Impresos Americanos del Siglo XVI en las Bibliotecas del Mundo project is an international collaboration of more than 25 institutional partners throughout Mexico, Spain, Peru, and the United States that seeks to bring together digitally the first books printed in the Americas before 1601. The collection provides unique primary sources for a variety of academic fields studying Indigenous and Spanish American society during the sixteenth century.

This site serves as an experiment to aggregate resources held by Cushing Memorial Library that are hosted in DSPACE and serve via an exhibit using IIIF.
